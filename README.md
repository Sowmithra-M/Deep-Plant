## Description

This consists of the implementations of our 

* CLEF (2018) with titled [Plant Classification based on Gated Recurrent Unit](http://cs-chan.com/doc/CLEF2018.pdf). Please refer to the [GRU-CFA](https://github.com/cs-chan/Deep-Plant/tree/master/GRU-CFA) folder.

* T-IP (2018) with titled [Multi-Organ Plant Classification based on Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks](http://cs-chan.com/doc/TIP_Plant.pdf). Please refer to the [PlantStructNet](https://github.com/cs-chan/Deep-Plant/tree/master/PlantStructNet) folder. The preliminary version of this work was presented earlier in ICIP-17 -- [HGO-CNN: Hybrid generic-organ convolutional neural network for multi-organ plant classification](http://cs-chan.com/doc/ICIP_CR.pdf). Please refer to the [HGO-CNN](https://github.com/cs-chan/Deep-Plant/tree/master/HGO-CNN) folder.

* PR (2017) with titled [How Deep Learning Extracts and Learns Leaf Features for Plant Classification](http://cs-chan.com/doc/PR2017.pdf). The preliminary version of this work was presented earlier in ICIP-15 -- [Deep-plant: Plant identification with convolutional neural networks](http://cs-chan.com/doc/150608425v1.pdf). Please refer to the [PR2017](https://github.com/cs-chan/Deep-Plant/tree/master/PR2017) folder.
